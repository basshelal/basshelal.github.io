<h1>About Bassam Helal</h1>

<div class="about-content">
    <p>
        I'm a software developer with a strong passion for building maintainable, well-tested and performant software.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am confident with Java, C, Kotlin and TypeScript. I am <i>less</i> confident with C++ and bash but have enough
        experience to figure things out along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        My software interests mainly lie in low-level high performance (low latency) software but my experience is
        mostly with higher level software.
    </p>
    <p>
        I use GNU/Linux on my personal computer. I have a preference for Debian GNU/Linux but all GNU/Linuxes
        are not too different from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a strong interest in languages, particularly etymology, phonology and morphology.
        I know English and Classical Arabic fluently and am currently learning Classical Persian and have some
        experience with literary Ottoman Turkish.
    </p>
    <p>
        I deeply enjoy <i>active</i> listening to music, particularly Classical Ottoman Music, but I believe all music
        has <i>some</i> inherent beauty and value.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website is simply an archive and log of my ideas, mostly for myself to read (and cringe at) in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website is written entirely in hand-written HTML, CSS and minimal JavaScript. I hate web frameworks
        (and web development in general).
