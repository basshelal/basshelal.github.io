    <p>
        As of writing this article, my current opinion and stance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is extremely negative.
        I say "as of writing" because I am always open to changing my mind and I do quite enjoy when I am wrong (for
        the better). I have almost no knowledge in artificial intelligence systems, I took a semester in university
        that taught the basics but have never done anything since then, I am essentially unqualified to speak about
        this.

        I am writing this article in the hopes that I can look back on it either with cringe or with
        pride, I have no preference, but I want an archive to look back on when I am (hopefully) wiser.
    </p>

    <p>
        AI tools have sprung up rapidly in the last decade but especially in the last few years. Of course some kind
        of artificial intelligence has existed for as long as computers have been programmable. Think about the
        earliest video games such as "Pong" which had a somewhat primitive form of artificial intelligence to play
        against.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly, programmers have always been able to add helpful features into their software which simulate some
        basic artificial intelligence. When you quit your text editor without saving your changes, the editor will
        not simply quit but instead is aware of your unsaved changes and asks you whether you want to save your
        progress. The program understands typical human behavior and accommodates its own behavior to suit it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course such a behavior is never labelled as artificial intelligence and is instead labelled as a feature,
        but I think this is, at least in a very broad sense, an artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, artificial intelligence systems have long existed in games from as early as the aforementioned
        "Pong" to as simple as the Chess games that come bundled with most Operating Systems, to the complex systems
        of today's racing games and real-time strategy games. Games have always had some form of artificial
        intelligence and usually one that is much more akin to what most people refer to as artificial intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the new artificial intelligences of the last decade or so are very different, and it is for one sole
        reason that I have a vehement stance against them.
    </p>

    <p><b>
        Modern artificial intelligences are black boxes, where there is no source code to refer back to for
        explanations and understanding.
    </b></p>

    <p>
        When a software program behaves incorrectly or unexpectedly, there is <i>always some</i> way to understand
        why it did so. Bugs may take a long time to explain or discover, but they are indeed explainable because they
        are written by a human and executed by a (usually) predictable machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        In most (if not all) programming languages, the following statement will be true:
        <br>
        <code>0.1 + 0.2 == 0.30000000000000004</code>
        <br>
        This may be seen as undesirable or unexpected behavior, but there is indeed an explanation for such behavior.
        After all, someone wrote this behavior into the programming language's environment, so someone knows about
        why, and even if that person themselves no longer knew, there is source code that will at least show why this
        happens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Compare this to any of the modern AI systems that have come out in the last decade, whether generative or
        assistive in their goal. Any AI system that is trained on large datasets (the majority of modern AI systems)
        will have no clear, obvious, referencable reason why they produce a particular result because there is no
        source code. When an AI image generator struggles to generate human fingers correctly, there is no specific
        place to point to as the reason for this fault. One cannot go into the source code to explain or fix the
        problem because there is no source code, there is no explanation, it is truly a black box.
    </p>

    <p>
        Actually that's not entirely true. AI systems are trained with purpose and intent, desirable results are
        programmed such that they are more likely to be produced, and inversely so for undesirable results. However,
        this only <i>influences</i> the black box, it does not directly control it, the black box can still change
        its internal implementation to suit these (and more) desirable results while still remaining an unknown black
        box.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is absolutely terrifying and dangerous for both the programmer and the user. The user may receive
        unexpected results that the programmer has no real way of explaining, only an <i>attempt</i> at fixing;
        retrain the AI system.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can thus say that the program is predictable even when it is incorrect, but not the AI
    </p>

    Trained AI has unknown internals, unknown motives

    Spews garbage, the most garbage of humans

    Ethically immoral, no more human touch ever, the more you give it the less it needs you
