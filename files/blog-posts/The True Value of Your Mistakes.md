# The True Value of Your Mistakes

Perhaps the most valuable thing I have ever gained through experience is 
a philosophy or mindset that I used to call _"The Hacker's Mindset"_. 
The name is a little misrepresenting because it has nothing to do with those kinds of hackers 
(cyber-security _"hackers"_) but rather, makes use of the more classical use of the term _hacker_,
ie someone who is more akin to a (software) tinkerer, someone who experiments and tries novel or unorthodox
solutions to (software) problems. While writing this article I realized _"Tinkerer"_ is a more suitable term
to use, but regardless of the name or terminology, the mindset is the same.
This mindset isn't only used for software or technology related fields, in 
fact it has started to penetrate more and more aspects of my life slowly. However, it is probably most useful
and most commonly found and manifested in software and technology in general. Let me explain...

I recently watched a video on YouTube titled: 
[_"My Best Decision Professionally"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqpFCuPAEPo) where 
[ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen) talks about his best professional/career decision in 
response to a tweet asking the same question. His answer felt more like a philosophy or manner of thought or even
approach to problems, rather than a true _decision_, ie something he made a choice about. His video and response
is excellent and I highly recommend watching it before continuing to read this article. His response was essentially
something to the effect of: Never shy away from a problem no matter how daunting, because you have solved difficult
problems before, and you will continue to solve difficult problems, so don't underestimate your abilities.

I _really_ like this video and the message that it sends, and it made me realize and contemplate something very similar
that I have started to notice in my subconscious mind in the last few years after I graduated from university. 
So many of the decisions I hold with great pride that have affected my life very positively have all come from moments 
where I should have _not_ made the decision if my _logical_ mind was acting strongly, but instead this other side 
of my mind acted over me and said that one great line stated before every regrettable action:

> _**"Fuck it"**_

You see, my _logical_ mind is a negative, pessimistic, neurotic freak that is afraid of almost anything with any 
risk or change. We all have a side of our mind or personality like this, the side of your brain that tells you _not_
to try that new blend of coffee or the new Coke flavor, and it's the same side of your brain that also dreads when
change happens to sometimes even minor things that you didn't ask for, such as a new UI layout on your favorite websites
or a new traffic light on your usual route to work. Change is scary because it's unpredictable and this part of our 
minds will often take it to the extremes to think about how this often minor change could affect our lives 
drastically forever. I'm being very serious about this, my mind does this all the time with sometimes extremely 
mundane things like when my web browser changed the rounded-ness of the URL bar, or when they stopped making my 
favorite model of headphones, or when my phone updates to the latest ugly and insulting version of Android. In 
every instance, my mind always, even if for a brief moment, went to the extremes to think, _"My life will 
never be the same"_ or _"Now I have to change everything in my life to adapt to this change"_.

This part of the mind is actually very useful and beneficial to have, but it's also quite hindering and can 
quickly consume your entire life and mentality. It can start to affect more serious decisions, and then eventually
even risk-free and obvious decisions to the point where with _any_ decision you face, your neurotic mind will always
have a strong influence on how you evaluate your final decision. What is very useful when thinking about making a large
impulse purchase for a new cellphone, can quickly devolve into a mindset that stops you from trying new things and 
experiences.

The most important decision I have made since graduating was switching to using GNU/Linux as my daily operating system.
Not necessarily because GNU/Linux is superior, but because this was such a huge move and change from what I was 
comfortable with for so long (Windows), that looking back I still don't know how I convinced myself or managed to do it.
I do indeed remember the reasons very well (perhaps I will write about them one day), but the final taking of action 
is something I shouldn't have done. Leaving my old way of life, throwing it all behind to try out this new operating 
system I had heard wonders about and only used myself a handful of times. It makes no sense. But I remember the 
mentality and I remember what I said before I took the action:

> _"Fuck it, what's the worst that could happen"_

Really, what was the worst that could happen? I lose my Windows configurations and programs, I have a bad experience 
with GNU/Linux and come right back to Windows. All I would have lost was time, but it would have been time 
experiencing something new and learning a new way of using a computer, a benefit from a certain perspective. _That_ 
is what this mentality is all about, measuring the worst case scenario and preparing for it such that the only thing 
you could lose is your time. But even then, spending your time on experiencing something new is extremely valuable 
because in the worst case, you know you don't like GNU/Linux and now you know that and have experienced it for yourself.

After I switched to GNU/Linux by a year I started playing around with Raspberry Pis and really wanted to see how 
small you could go and still have small cheap single-purpose machines, which led me to the Pi Zero, the smallest 
Raspberry Pi you could get at the time. Then I found the Raspberry Pi Pico, a small microcontroller costing $10. To 
this day I don't know why I did this, but I bought 2 and a breadboard kit to play around with.

My point is that you not only need to be willing to make and experience mistakes, but in fact embrace them and look 
forward to them, because ever mistake is a lesson, a lesson that no book, teacher or course can teach with such 
effectiveness.
